# Prototype-SN

This is the OLD Location. Please see: https://github.com/EarthwiseFramework/Prototype-SN

The Earthwise SDSS prototype used for the Sierra Nevada Mountains. (Note that it was originally called LandAdvisor.)

ArcGIS 10.x is required for this tool. ArcPro may work. For some tips in getting this model running on your machine, see the documents in this google drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6x6qJKMGdJhYmZ0YnJQUTJza2c?usp=sharing

All the input data are in this zip folder: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6x6qJKMGdJhUEl0VEN0aU5ySms/view?usp=sharing Note: output and temp data, along with data from several runs, are also in this folder.  John Gallo will be cleaning this up at some point. If you are reading this, and would appreciate the cleaned up version, please contact John and he'll raise it up in the to do list and get that loaded asap.
